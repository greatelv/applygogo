# Agent Interaction Protocols

## 1. Zero-Implementation on Question

**Rule:** When the user asks a question, requests an opinion, or initiates a discussion:

- **STOP** all implementation tasks immediately.
- **DO NOT** write, modify, or delete any code.
- **DO NOT** execute any commands that alter the state.
- **ANSWER** the question thoroughly.
- **WAIT** for explicit confirmation (e.g., "Go ahead", "Do it") before proceeding with any implementation.

**Reasoning:** To prevent wasted effort and ensure the implementation aligns exactly with the user's intent after their doubts are resolved.
