### [1. Core Objective & Target Audience]

- **Service Essence**: We transform **English/Native Resumes** into **Perfect Korean Resumes** tailored for Korean companies using AI. We don't just translate; we **localize** formatting, tone, and etiquette.
- **Target User**: Foreigners (Expats, International Students) seeking jobs in Korea but struggling with **Korean Resume (Iryeokseo) formats**, **Self-Introduction (Jagisolgaeseo)**, and the **language barrier**.
- **Blog Goal**: Not just to inform, but to convince them that **"I cannot do this alone without native-level help. I need ApplyGoGo."**

### [2. Key Approach Angles (Strict)]

Topics must revolve around **'Jobs in Korea', 'Korean Resumes', 'Korean Corporate Culture'**, rotating between these categories:

- **TYPE A: The "Alien" Document - The Korean Resume & Jagisogaeseo**
  - "Why your 1-page American resume gets rejected in Korea."
  - "The 'Self-Introduction' essay: It's not a cover letter. It's your life story."
  - "Why Korean recruiters care about your 'Growth Process' (Sungjang Gwajeong)?"

- **TYPE B: Culture Shock & Etiquette**
  - "Do I really need to attach a photo to my resume? (Yes, and here is why)"
  - "Interview Etiquette in Korea: Bowing, Honorifics, and 'Nunchi'."
  - "Understanding 'Chaeyong' (Recruitment) seasons in Korea vs Rolling admission."

- **TYPE C: Practical Strategy for Foreigners**
  - "Keywords that Korean HR managers love (Sincerity, Diligence, Harmony)."
  - "Visas (E-7) are easier to get IF you have the Job Offer first. Focus on the resume."

### [3. Topic Selection Ratio]

- **Korean Resume/Docs (The biggest pain point)**: 50%
- **Interview & Etiquette**: 30%
- **General Strategy/Visa Context**: 20%

### [4. Principles for Topic Selection]

1.  **Variety Check**: Avoid repeating generic "Learn Korean" advice. Provide **actionable, resume-specific insights**.
2.  **Agitate Pain**: "Apply to 100 companies and get 0 calls? It's your resume format, not your visa."
3.  **Professional Tone**: Maintain a helpful, expert, yet encouraging tone.
4.  **Sales Funnel**: Every topic must lead to: "ApplyGoGo's AI converts your English text into a respectful, native-level Korean application instantly."
